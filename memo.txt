Melon Survey
Technology behind this tool

Architecture Web framework / HTML Template
What is HTML TEMPLATE?
What is SPA?
LAMP -> MERN(MEAN, MEVN)
Why the popularity
- Mobile apps integration with REST
- Team Isolation
- Specialization in Ecosystem
- Interactive content with JS
- PWA
Weakness of SPA
- SEO
- Duplication of Models
Web Framework != SPA
Beyond spa
Next.js Nuxt.js Gatsby.js ...
Duplication of model
Graphql / gRPC for Code Generation

- Microservice vs Monolithic
Are APIs Microservice?
No 
Microservice is more about splitting a service by domain
From GUI to Database
Why Microservice?
- Team Isolation
- Scalability
Weakness of Microservice 
- Difficult to build with performance without a proper DevOps and Architect

Docker / K8s
Docker vs Vagrant + Ansible
Speed
- Download time
DockerScript
- No idempotence like ansible
- More like destroying a vagrant image
- Faster with caching
Caching
- Caching middle layer
Operation
Orchastration => K8s
Cloud Services
Many cloud services support Container operation which support auto scaling
ECS Fargate
EKS
Google Cloud Run
GKE

Golang
What is golang?
Developed by Google, to replace C++
Strength of golang
- Concurrency 
- Performant => 30x php
- Cleaner than C++
- Amazing tooling

Weakness
Dependencies Managed with GOPATH => Docker + Go mod
Lack of generics

Graphql
A query language for your API / Replacement for REST
Specification not an implementation
Mutation types are seperate from query Types
Generated Documentation
DEMO
@depricated

Gqlgen
Code Generation
Directives
circular dependency can be handle with generated resolvers

Authentification
Jwt vs sesssion
Splitting JWT
Graphql Directives
Authorization
Doing join to ensure the user is the one mutating or referencing is costly
Caching with Redis (Concept)
Values mutated or accessed are generally queried beforehand
Session keys are connected to Protobuffer val on Redis with dictionary which contain ids of manipulatable objects

Apollo-Client
Code Generation
Reusable Query through Importing Fragments
Powerful Caching replacing vuex

Typescript/Vue/Vue-Bootstrap/ES6
Nuxt is powerful with VueX, Vue Router, UI framework, Jest, Eslint, Prettier and SSR support
While setting up Typescript is painfull Typescript + Graphql is good
When learning typescript use "any" if confused 
Fix any when you know better with eslint

Reshaping Data types is a must while dealing with Vue-Bootstrap
Destructuring
Spread Operator
Key/property shorthand

Test
- Milestones for testing method
testing with test values written in test code
-> table testing
-> golden testing

- Milestones for Testing Environments
Fresh Code ? TDD : Code Coverage -> Continuous Integration -> Continuous Delivery -> Continuous Deployment

CI
Continuous delivery of docker
